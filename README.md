## About

This app had been created to help you out with sorting and managing your books. 
You can add them and mark them as read or add to favorites or to the queue 
for reading. It is my intention to add contacts in this app so user could 
communicate with others. In the project I use google books API and firebase 
for managing users and storing their data.
